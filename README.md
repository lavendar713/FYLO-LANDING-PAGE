## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was really hard for me, it took quite some time to complete but ultimately I was able to complete it.  Basically what i learned in this was patience, i was so in a hurry to complete thinking I've mastered it all but it turns out I still have a long way to go with my learning.

I also learned how to add social media icons to an HTML file and styling with CSS. Explored a bit more with media queries as well. 

### Continued development

Futher development would be in Javascript as I encountered some issues that was diificult to tackle unless with some in-depth knowledge in Javascript.
